# 📚 Book Recommendation System  

This is an **AI-powered Book Recommendation System** that helps users discover books similar to their chosen title based on **genre and author**. Built using **Streamlit**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Pandas**, the system leverages **TF-IDF vectorization** and **cosine similarity** to provide accurate book recommendations.

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Personalized Recommendations** – Get book suggestions based on genre and author.  
✅ **Intuitive UI** – Built using **Streamlit**, providing an easy-to-use interface.  
✅ **Machine Learning-Powered** – Uses **TF-IDF Vectorization** and **Cosine Similarity** to find similar books.  
✅ **Dynamic Background** – A visually appealing background GIF enhances user experience.  
✅ **Fast & Lightweight** – No need for deep learning, making it fast and resource-efficient.

## 📊 Dataset  

The dataset `br.csv` contains the following columns:  
- `title` – Name of the book  
- `author` – Author of the book  
- `genre` – Genre classification  

These features are **combined** to compute book similarity.

---

## 🖥 Usage  

1. **Select a Book** – Use the dropdown menu to pick a book title.  
2. **Get Recommendations** – The system will suggest books with similar genres and authors.  
3. **Explore & Enjoy!** – Use the recommendations to discover new books.  

---

## 🔬 How It Works  

1️⃣ **Text Processing**  
   - Combines the `genre` and `author` columns.  
   - Converts them into numerical values using **TF-IDF Vectorization**.  

2️⃣ **Similarity Computation**  
   - Computes **Cosine Similarity** between books based on their text features.  
   - Finds the most similar books to the selected title.  

3️⃣ **Recommendation Display**  
   - Displays the top `N` similar books in the Streamlit app.

## 🚀 Future Improvements  

✅ Add **user ratings & reviews** for better recommendations.  
✅ Implement **deep learning models** for improved accuracy.  
✅ Enhance **UI/UX** with more styling and interactivity.  
✅ Allow **user-inputted books** to find similar recommendations.
